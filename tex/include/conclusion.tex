\section{Conclusion} % (fold)
We have shown how the $Orange$ software package implements the Bayesian Classifiers and how it can be very useful for quickly solving real world problems. Some areas of consideration for additional explanation are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Evaluation on another "real-world" data set
\item High dimensional data (data sets where there are a much larger amount of explanatory variables as compared with the number of observations)
\item Comparison with other classifiers (Support vector machines, Neural Networks, etc)
\end{enumerate}

In summation, Bayesian Classifiers are a versatile tool with applications to real world data sets.
